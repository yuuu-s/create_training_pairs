# Create prompt窶田ompletion pairs with OpenAI API
This repository processes cleaned song lyrics and sends them to the OpenAI API to generate concise lyric summaries, which are used to construct prompt窶田ompletion pairs for future model fine-tuning.

The dataset comprises 10,681 song lyrics. Summaries were generated using the GPT-5-Nano model at a total cost of $3.44.

Example of prompt窶田ompletion pairs:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Write a rap song in year 2009's Eminem style. The topic is about:...",
  "completion": "title \n\n lyrics"
}
```
